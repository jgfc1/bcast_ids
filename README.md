*Gesti√≥n Tributaria Territorial (GTT), Network dept., Alicante (Spain), 2020*
## Abstract
Network intrusion is a growing threat with severe impacts, which can damage in several ways to network infrastructures and digital assets in the well-known cyberspace. A modern technique employed to combat against network intrusion is the development of attack detection systems using Machine Learning and Data Mining. These approaches can help to protect networks because they are able to identify malicious network traffic. BCAST_IDS is a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS), which attempts to identify unauthorized and anomalous behaviour in a Local Area Network (LAN) looking at the broadcast and unicast traffic. For that, it monitors network activity on one network segment. Then, the system constantly performs analysis and watches for certain traffic patterns. If the detected traffic pattern match the defined policies in the Machine Learning model, a security alert will be generated.

## Description
Machine Learning and Data Mining techniques work by establishing an implicit or explicit model which enables to categorize data patterns. Since network intrusion and Malware activities can be considered as anomalies (outliers), BCAST_IDS uses an unsupervised Machine Learning algorithm, called [**Isolation Forest**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.IsolationForest.html), that explicitly identifies them. In principle, outliers are less frequent than regular observations and are different from them in terms of values (they lie further away from the regular observations in the feature space). 

The aforementioned algorithm is built on the basis of [decision trees](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html) and the main idea of identifying normal and abnormal activity is in the path length of the tree. A normal point requires more partitions to be identified than abnormal point.

There are three main phases to make this project comes true:
1. **Preprocessing:** feature selection and feature extraction. Data instances that are colleted from the network environment are structured.
2. **Training:** a Machine Learning algorithm is used to extract patterns from the data collected previously. Then, a system model is built.
3. **Detection:** the monitored traffic data will be used as system input to be compared to the generated system model. If the pattern of the observation is matched with a potential threat, an alarm will be triggered and it will indicate a feasible network intrusion.

The following picture represents an overview of the BCAST_IDS architecture:

The system will also generate the following files:
- **JSON files: (time is represented as a integer number expressed in seconds since the epoch, in UTC)**

| File name  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| **tip.json**  | {IP source subnet:time}. Active source IPs (v.4) which belong to the network range specified in the `NET` attribute of the config file |
| **tm.json**  | {MAC source:time}. Active source MACs  |
| **externos.json**  | {IP source:time}. Active source IPs which do not belong to the network range specified in the `NET` attribute of the config file  |
| **ti6.json**  | {MAC source:time}. Active source IPs (v.6) |
| **ipf.json**  | {IP source_IP destination:time}. ARP trafic generated between two existing IPs which belong to the network range specified in the 'NET' attribute of the config file |
| **ipm.json**  |  {MAC source:IP source}. Active source MACs and IPs which have generated ARP traffic in the network range specified in the config file |
| **tips-week.json**  | {IP source:time}. Active source IPs (v.4) which belong to the network range specified in the `NET` attribute of the config file. It has a week expiration by default |
| **tm-month.json**  | {MAC source:time}. Active source MACs which have a month expiration by default |

- **LOG files**

| File name  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| **macs_abnormal_act.log**  | It indicates the MACs that the algorithm has detected as abnormal |
| **messages_training.log**  | It indicates if the automated training of the algorithm was okay or not  |
| **new_macs_detected.log**  | MACs detected for the first time and which are not found in the tm-month.json file before  |
| **email_messages.log**  | It indicates if the email was sent correctly or not |

- **PCAP files**

| File name  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| **./bcast_ids/forensic/{MAC}/{date}.cap**  | It contains the suspicious traffic that the algorithm has identified of a MAC or a set of MACs in the network capture|
| **round{num}.cap**  | Save the packet data in a cycled files obtained by tcpdump, which prints the headers of packets on a network interface that match the boolean expression|


### Dataset Generation
The training dataset is collected from a real-world connected environment. At this point, the main features have to be identified. There are a whole bunch of features that can be monitored by networking tools for network analysis over the network, but some of them could be redundant. So, we have selected nineteen features and are listed below:

| Feature  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| MAC  | MAC address  |
| num_MAC  | Total network packets generated from a specific MAC address |
| UCAST  | Total UNICAST traffic generated from a specific MAC address |
| MCAST  | Total MULTICAST traffic generated from a specific MAC address  |
| BCAST  | Total BROADCAST traffic generated from a specific MAC address  |
| ARPrq  | Total ARP Request traffic generated from a specific MAC address  |
| ARPpb  | Total ARP Probe traffic generated from a specific MAC address  |
| ARPan  | Total ARP Announcement traffic generated from a specific MAC address  |
| ARPgr  | Total ARP Gratitous traffic generated from a specific MAC address  |
| IPF  | Total ARP Request generated from a specific MAC address to an IP address which exists   |
| IP_ICMP  | Total IP ICMP traffic generated from a specific MAC address  |
| IP_UDP  | Total IP UDP traffic generated from a specific MAC address  |
| IP_TCP  | Total IP TCP traffic generated from a specific MAC address  |
| IP_RESTO  | Other traffic generated from a specific MAC address  |
| IPv6  | Total IPv6 traffic generated from a specific MAC address  |
| ETH_RESTO  | Total ETHERNET traffic generated from a specific MAC address  |
| ARP_noIP  | Total ARP Request generated from a specific MAC address to an IP address which does NOT exist   |
| SSDP  | Total SSDP traffic generated from a specific MAC address   |
| ICMPv6  | Total ICMPv6s traffic generated from a specific MAC address   |

Once the features were determined to fed the Isolation Forest algorithm later, the next step is to generate the data. This is typically implemented in stages based first on an attack-free netwok and then a number of attacks until all the classes that need to be considered are fully covered by the dataset. The final dataset will cover distinct attack types and attack-free circumstances.

### Run the Project

#### Download

```
git clone https://github.com/redesgtt/bcast_ids.git
```
Then you need to install the basic dependencies to run the project on your system:
```
cd bcast_ids
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Wait for the requirements to download, it may take a while. Once they are downloaded, you are good to go!

#### Preprocessing
1. Firstly, make sure you are as a 'root' user and you fill up correctly the variables of config.txt file (`IFACE2`, `NET`, `EXCLUDE_MACS`...). Execute `./post.sh` in order to generate a dataset. Remember that in this phase the variable `GENERATE_DATASET` should set to 'yes'. Keep this script running. If you want to run it at the background you can type `./post.sh &` at the command prompt. Network traffic is analized each 10 seconds by default (`POST` variable).
2. The dataset is now generating and is growing over time. Type `tail -f dataset.csv` at the command prompt to observe it. 
3. It is time to make some kind of **cyberattacks to your own network**. If you are in a Wifi network, try to download any **network scanning tool in order to make outliers in the data**. For that, you can use your smartphone or tablet. There are plenty of them in the App Store (iOs) or Play Store (Android), i.e. [Net Analyzer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.techet.netanalyzerlite.an&hl=es_419). If want to use a distinct PC computer to perform cyberattacks, you can employ `nmap, arp-scan, netdiscover...` Make sure that the devices your perform the cyberattacks and BCAST_IDS are connected in the same network.
4. Observe the data which is generated in the `dataset.csv`. Combine normal and abnormal entries. It is highly recommended that the dataset has 10.000-12.000 lines.
6. At the same time, you can also see the .json files. Remember that, their time expiration can be modified in config.txt file through `UPDATE_TIME_JSON_HOUR`, `UPDATE_TIME_JSON_12HOURS`, `UPDATE_TIME_JSON_WEEK` and `UPDATE_TIME_JSON_MONTH` properties.

#### Trainning
##### Automated training
1. If there is no a Machine Learning model in the bcast_ids directory, the system can extract data patterns automatically from the data collected at `dataset.csv` so far, taking into account the countdown specified in `TIME_AUTOMATED_TRAINING`. Also, make sure `AUTOMATED_TRAINING` is set to 'yes'. Remember you can adjust the contamination parameter of the Isolation Forest algorithm in the config file (it is set to 'auto' by default).
2. Once the countdown is over and if everything went as expected, a model will be created in the bcast_ids folder with the name 'model_iso_forest.bin' and the results could be checked at the file `training_messages.log`. Otherwise, an message error will appear at the aforementioned log file.
3. You can use the notebook `Notebook - BCAST_IDS Lite Version.ipynb` in order to perform some visualizations of the data you are collected and the abnormal points in a three-dimensional space. 

##### Manual training
1. You can use the script `./train_iso_forest.py` manually to extract patterns from the data collected in the file `dataset.csv`. Feel free to change the contamination parameter `-c`, that is the proportion of outliers in the dataset. Note that this value must be between 0 and 0.5. Analyze the outliers given by the algorithm.
2. Soon afterward, a model will be generated with the name `model_iso_forest.bin`.
3. Make some tests with the script `./predict_iso_forest.py` and verify the effectiveness of the Isolation Forest algorithm.
4. You can use the notebook `Notebook - BCAST_IDS Lite Version.ipynb` in order to perform some visualizations of the data you are collected and the abnormal points in a three-dimensional space. 

#### Detection
1. If the model has saved successfully and you have checked that the outliers detected by the algorithm are appropiate in the training phase, BCAST_IDS should predict anomalies on your network! If the algorithm detects any abnormal activity, it will be registered at `macs_abnormal_act.log`. Moreover if the system detects a new MAC in the network which was not in `tm-month.json`, it will be registered at `new_macs_detected.log`. 
2. Furthermore, a network capture will be saved if the algorithm detects any abnormal activity at the `./bcast_ids/forensic` directory.
3. Finally, if you want to receive an email when an anomaly is detected, change `SEND_EMAIL` property to `yes` and complete the variables `MAIL_SERVER`, `PORT_MAIL_SERVER`, `SENDER_EMAIL` and `RECEIVERS_EMAIL` on your own. You can check the log file `email_messages.log` in order to visualize if an email was sent successfully or there was a problem.
